## About
AutumnJS is a powerful JavaScript framework developed to facilitate the creation of robust and scalable web applications. Built on top of Express, a well-known Node.js framework, AutumnJS aims to provide a development experience similar to the Spring Framework, drawing inspiration from its architecture and patterns.

With AutumnJS, developers can leverage the familiarity of Express while benefiting from additional features that simplify and expedite the development process. The framework offers an organized and convention-driven structure, allowing developers to focus more on business logic rather than configuring technical details.

One of the key features of AutumnJS is dependency injection, a central concept in the Spring Framework. With this feature, developers can easily manage and connect application components, reducing complexity and promoting modularity. This allows different parts of the application to be developed and tested independently, increasing code maintainability and reusability.

AutumnJS's approach to route control and request flow is convention-based, following the principle of "convention over configuration." This means that by adopting recommended practices, developers can take advantage of a predefined structure for URL routing and request handling. This approach contributes to code standardization and enhances development team productivity.

With its flexible and modular architecture, combined with the ease of use of Express and inspiration from the Spring Framework, AutumnJS stands out as an attractive option for JavaScript web application development. Whether you're an experienced developer or someone starting to explore the world of web development, AutumnJS can help you efficiently and effectively create powerful and scalable applications.
